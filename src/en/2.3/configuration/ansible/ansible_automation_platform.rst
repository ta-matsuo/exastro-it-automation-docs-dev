Ansible Automation Platform
===========================

Introduction
========

| This guide aims to explain the system configuration and environment needed to operate Exastro IT Automation (hereinafter referred to as ITA)'s Ansible connectivity function (referred to as Ansible Driver)
| This guide will also explain system configurations and environments for using Ansible Automation Platform as an execution engine.
|
| For Ansible Core configurations, please see :doc:`./ansible_core`.
| 
| Exastro IT Automation must be installed in order to use the ITA Ansible driver.
| For instructions on how to install Exastro IT Automation, please see :doc:`../../installation/helm_on_kubernetes`.



Systen configuration
============

| The Ansible driver is a standard function available when deploying Exastro IT Automation.
|
| We recommend using Ansible Automation Platform configurations for scale-out architectures for the Ansible execution server.
|
| The diagram below illustrates an Ansible Automation Platform configuration pattern.

Systen configuration pattern
--------------------

| Ansible Automation Controller allows for operation of systems with better availability and the use of expanded functions when running Ansible.

.. warning:: 
   | The ITA system and Ansible core must be own their own servers.
   | Ansible Core (Ansibler driver (Agent)) is required, as it the Playbooks are encrypted using Ansible Vault.

| The following image illustrates a configuration pattern with the main Ansible driver functions.
| ※ The diagram does not include the Exastro ITA system.

     - | Ansible Automation Platform (Hybrid pattern)
     - | A configuration pattern that allows the Ansible Control node execute operations for Managed nodes.
       | While simple, this configuration requires a communication for each Managed node 
     - Yes
   * - 2
     - Ansible Automation Platform (Seperate Execution node pattern)
     - | A configuration where the Ansible Control node links with the Ansible Execution node in order to execute operations for Managed nodes.
       | In contrast to the Ansible Automation Platform (Hybrid pattern), this configuration is more complicated. In return, it allows the user to execute operations to the managed nodes as long as the Ansible Control node can communicate with the Ansible Execution node. The user does not need to configure communication settings for each Managed node.
     - Yes

System requirements
============

| The system requirements for Ansible driver are based on the ITA System requirements. See :doc:`../../installation/helm_on_kubernetes` for more information.
| The following are the system requirements for Ansible Automation Platform.

ITA Operation directory preparation
---------------------------

| Create a directory for ITA operations in the Ansible Automation Platform server.
| For cluster configurations, create the directory on all the configurating servers.
| The Ansible Automation Platform's Hon node does not need a directory.
|

ITA Operation directory publication
---------------------------

| Log in to the Ansible Automation Platform through your browser and set:menuselection:`Settings --> Job --> Path for publishing seperated jobs` to :file:`/var/lib/exastro/`.

.. figure:: /images/en/diagram/publish_ita_operation_directory.png
   :width: 600px


Ansible Automation Platform file transfer user preparation
----------------------------------------------------------

| When generating Ansible Automation Platform projects from ITA, you must transfer a set of Playbook files to the following directory in Ansible Automation Platform.
| Make sure to prepare a Linux user for file transfers.
|
| ・SCM management directory(/var/lib/awx/projects)
| 　※Use the linux user for Playbook transfers for Ansible Tower3.x.
| ・ITA operation directory(/var/lib/exastro)

| We highly recommend that the Linux user configures a password for the awx user generated when Ansible Automation Platform is installing.

.. warning:: 
 | Preparing and using users other than the awx user to change SCM management path (/var/lib/awx/projects) permissions is not within the scope of Red Hat support.

| The Linux user needs to be registered to the ITA System. See :ref:`ansible_common_ansible_automation_controller_hosts` for more information.


Ansible Automation Platform Git user preparation
----------------------------------------------------------

| The SCM type for projects generated from ITA to Ansible Automation Platform is using Git.
| The destination Git repository is created by the host installed by the Ansible driver backyard function.
| Make sure to prepare a Linux user for connecting to the Git repository with ssh key authentication from Ansible Automation Platform.

| The user will need a access token that allows them to create and operate.For more information, see :ref:`installation_kubernetes_gitlablinkage`.

Proxy settings
-----------

| When running Operations with Ansible Automation Platform settings, an execution environment container image is downloaded from a website specified by Red Hat.
| Log in to Ansible Automation Platform through your browser, access :menuselection:`Settings --> Job --> Add Environment variables` and configure the following environment variables.

-  https_proxy
-  http_proxy
-  no_proxy
-  HTTPS_PROXY
-  HTTP_PROXY
-  NO_PROXY

.. figure:: /images/en/diagram/proxy_settings.png
   :width: 600px

.. warning::
  | If the Ansible Automation Platform is running under a Proxy environment, the Proxy settings needs to be configured to Ansible Automation Platform. Running operations without Proxy settings might cause errors with unknown causes
