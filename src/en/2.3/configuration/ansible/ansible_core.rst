Introduction
========

| This guide aims to explain the system configuration and environment needed to operate Exastro IT Automation (hereinafter referred to as ITA)'s Ansible connectivity function (referred to as Ansible Driver)
| This guide will also explain system configurations and environments for using Ansible Core as an execution engine.
|
| For Ansible Automation Platform configurations, please see :doc:`./ansible_automation_platform`.
|
| Exastro IT Automation must be installed in order to use the ITA Ansible driver.
| For instructions on how to install Exastro IT Automation, please see :doc:`../../installation/helm_on_kubernetes`.


System configuration
============

| The Ansible driver is a standard function available when deploying Exastro IT Automation.
|
| Ansible Core configurations allows for simple Ansible executions.
|
| The diagram below illustrates an Ansible Core configuration pattern.

| ※1 The communication numbers corresponds to the numbers illustrated in the Ansible Core configuration diagram.
| ※2 The port numbers written are standard port numbers.
| ※3 These are examples. The protocols depends on the Ansible module.


System requirements
============

| The system requirements for Ansible driver are based on the ITA System requirements. See :doc:`../../installation/helm_on_kubernetes` for more information.


Playbook link
============

| The following diagram illustrates the Playbook links between ITA and Ansible Core.
| Exastro IT Automation relay connects with filesystems so it can work with Playbooks and Parameter values.

Initial settings
========

| After installing Ansible Core, make sure to prepare a shared directory that can be accessed by both Exastro IT Automation and Ansible Core.
| The shared directory should be created within the volume created in this manual;:ref:`persistent_volume`.
