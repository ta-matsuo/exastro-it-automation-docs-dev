==================
Terraform Cloud/EP
==================


Introduction
========

| This guide aims to explain the system configuration and environment needed to operate  Exastro IT Automation (hereinafter referred to as ITA)'s Terraform Cloud/Enterprise connectivity function.
|
| Exastro IT Automation must be installed in order to use the Terraform Cloud/EP driver.
| For instructions on how to install Exastro IT Automation, please see :doc:`../../installation/helm_on_kubernetes`.


System configuration
============

| The Terraform Cloud/EP driver is only provided if selected when deploying Exastro IT Automation.
|
| In order to use Terraform, the user must have Terraform Enterprise on a server different from the ITA server or be using Terraform Cloud.
| If the Terraform Automated configuration's execution target is on-premise and cannot directly be connected from the cloud, you might want to consider using a configuration that uses Terraform Cloud Agents.

|
| The diagram below illustrates a configuration pattern using Terraform Cloud/EP.

System requirements
============

| The system requirements for Terraform Cloud/EP driver are based on the ITA System requirements. See :doc:`../../installation/helm_on_kubernetes` for more information.
| This section covers the system requirements for Terraform Enterprise and Terraform cloud.
