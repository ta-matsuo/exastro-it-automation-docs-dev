| This guide aims to explain the system configuration and environment needed to operate  Exastro IT Automation (hereinafter referred to as ITA)'s Terraform CLI connectivity function (herenafter referred to as Terraform CLI driver)
|
| Exastro IT Automation must be installed in order to use the Terraform CLI driver.
| For instructions on how to install Exastro IT Automation, please see :doc:`../../installation/helm_on_kubernetes`.


System configuration
